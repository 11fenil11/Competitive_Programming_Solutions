All submissions for this problem are available.Chef is making polygon cakes in his kitchen today!

Since the judge panel is very strict, Chef's cakes must be beautiful and have sharp and precise internal angles in arithmetic progression.

Given the number of sides, N, of the cake Chef is baking today and also the measure of its first angle(smallest angle), A, find the measure of the Kth angle.*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int hcf(int num,int den);
int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int test;
	cin>>test;
	while(test!=0)
	{   
	    int n,sum,k;long long int a;
	    cin>>n;cin>>a;cin>>k;
	    sum=180*(n-2);
	    int den=n*(n-1);
	    int num=(a*den)+((k-1)*(2*sum-2*a*n));
	    int result=hcf(num,den);
	    
	    cout<<num/result<<" "<<den/result<<endl;
	    test--;
	}
	return 0;
}

int hcf(int num,int den)
{  int max;
    (num>den)?max=den:max=num;
     int hcf;
    for(int i=1;i<=max;i++)
